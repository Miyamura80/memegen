"""
API Routes Package

This package contains all API route modules. When adding a new route:
1. Create your route module in this directory (or subdirectory)
2. Import the router here with a descriptive name (e.g., `router as <feature>_router`)
3. Add it to the `all_routers` list
4. The router will be automatically included in the FastAPI app

See .cursor/rules/routes.mdc for detailed instructions.
