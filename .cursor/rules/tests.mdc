## Writing tests

Whenever implementing a new feature, always encourage the user to write a test.

Tests are written using pytest. To add a new test, create a new file/directory in the `tests/` directory. Ensure, that whenever you create a new directory in the `tests/` directory, you also add a `tests/.../__init__.py` to the directory so python can recognize the test directory.


### Test structure

Look at below example for how you should write tests.

```python
from tests.test_template import TestTemplate, slow_test, nondeterministic_test
from common import global_config

class TestSkeleton(TestTemplate):
    # Initialize shared variables here for all tests
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def setup_shared_variables(self, setup):
        # Initialize shared attributes here
        pass

    # Actual test code here
    # Possibly @slow_test or @nondeterministic_test
    def test_function(self):
        # Any actual test code here
        assert True
```



Few things to note:
- Inherit from `TestTemplate` (see `tests/test_template.py`) for proper test setup
- Use `self.config` for test configuration (loaded from `tests/config.yaml`)
- Prefix tests with `test_` and use `@slow_test` or `@nondeterministic_test` decorator for slow and/or nondeterministic tests
- Never use `unittest`, always use pytest
