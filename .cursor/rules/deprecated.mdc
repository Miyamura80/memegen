This is a reminder on deprecated modules you should be careful about.

## Datetime

datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated. Use timezone-aware objects to represent datetimes in UTC.

Example:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

print(datetime.now(timezone.utc))
```

## Deprecation Warnings

Deprecation warnings are a pain to deal with, if they cannot be dealt with in the codebase, please use `pytest.ini` to ignore them.
