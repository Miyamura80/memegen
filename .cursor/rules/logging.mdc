## Logging Configuration

This project uses a centralized logging configuration with `loguru`. Always use the standardized logging format by importing and calling the setup function from `src/utils/logging_config.py`.

```python
from loguru import logger as log
from src.utils.logging_config import setup_logging

# Setup logging at the start of your file
setup_logging()

# Then use logger as needed
log.info("Info message")
log.error("Error message")
log.debug("Debug message")
```

The standardized format includes:
- Log level (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
- Timestamp (HH:mm:ss)
- Message

Example output:
```
INFO   12:34:56 |  Starting application
ERROR  12:34:57 |  Failed to connect to database
```

Never configure logging directly in your files. Always use the centralized configuration to maintain consistent logging format across the entire application.

If for whatever reason some log is not showing up, check the `common/global_config.yaml` file to see if the log level is set to true. The logging configuration is validated using pydantic-settings to ensure correct types.

```yaml file=common/global_config.yaml
logging:
  # ... Other logging config ...
  levels:
    debug: false
    info: true
    warning: true
    error: true
    critical: true
```
